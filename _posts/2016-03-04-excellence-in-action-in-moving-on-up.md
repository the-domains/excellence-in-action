My tagline for over 20 years now has been "Excellence in Action!" I developed that motto for my life as a reminder to always concern myself with quality and movement. I didn't want to get stale or be mediocre. Excellence in Action has been the tagline for my business before I became a lawyer and has been the tagline for my law practice since the day I became licensed on September 10, 1998\.

In August of 2015, I became a John Maxwell certified trainer, speaker, and personal coach. I named my leadership company "Kirk & Hazel Company" (with the first name being a variation of my middle name and the second name being the color of my eyes). Now that I am going back to Orlando, Florida for my second live event with the John Maxwell Team, I have decided that I truly want to ramp up that part of my life. Being that Kirk & Hazel Company simply doesn't give anyone any idea of what the company does, I have decided to rename the company "Excellence in Action, LLC" as a better way to describe what that company and I are all about!

I look forward to working with my colleagues and clients in building Excellence in Action! Let's get this party started, right!
