            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Excellence in Action in Moving on Up!</h1><p>     My tagline for over 20 years now has been "Excellence in Action!" I developed that motto for my life as a reminder to always concern myself with quality and movement. I didn't want to get stale or be mediocre. Excellence in Action has been the tagline for my business before I became a lawyer and has been the tagline for my law practice since the day I became licensed on September 10, 1998.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/69553b4071966cf33a2306d477ee19c065f2ca02.jpg"></article>]]></description>
